# Summary
This website will keep track of all the world cup 2018 brackets you and your friends put in to the firebase database. Since this application is only for my friends, I did not include a login section since most of them are not willing to give out their emails. 

# Goal
The goal is to have a website where my friends and I could see each other's world cup bracket and determine who got the most prediction correct. The app will automatically update the point table depending on what it reads in the firebase database. The app also includes a comment section so that we can comment each other's bracket.
